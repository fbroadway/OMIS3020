We will use these to both demonstrate course concepts and apply them to analyze data and build models. This document is a Jupyter Notebook: it allows us to mix text, visuals, code, and mathematical notation in an interative way. This notebook will demonstrate a few basic Python and Notebook concepts that will be used throughout the course - if you have used either before, this notebook will largely be a review.\n","\n","Cells of a notebook are generally either text cells (like this one) or code cells (the cell below).
